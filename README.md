Brief Description of your Solution -
The project's goal is to create a social media platform where people who love food can discuss their dining adventures. Users can view profiles of other users, follow them, like and comment on their posts, upload up to four photos, write descriptions, edit, or delete them, by creating posts. Additionally, users will be notified when someone interacts with their posts such as liking and commenting on their posts. The platform will be secure, and the solution will consist of a user-friendly website. we are creating a REST API and a web application using Java and Spring Boot technology to complete this. This will enable us to create a solution that is scalable, maintainable, and accessible by multiple users at once. In order to track changes made during the project's development, our project will be version controlled using Git on GitHub.

Note - The student's github account should be given in brackets e.g. (asiriRepos), this ideally should be your student id
